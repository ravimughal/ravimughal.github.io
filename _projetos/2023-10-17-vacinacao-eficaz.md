Welcome to the repository of my amazing project, the result of my participation in the Shawee hackathon, the largest hackathon company in Brazil. In this hackathon, I had the honor of being part of a winning team that secured the first place in the logistics category and reached the tenth place in the overall competition.

## About the Project

In the Shawee hackathon, our challenge was to create a solution that would make the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines more efficient and cost-effective, taking into account shipping costs to different regions. To tackle this complex challenge, our team used JavaScript and the MapTiler API to develop an innovative algorithm.

### Objective

The primary objective of our project was to determine the most effective route for vaccine delivery, minimizing freight costs and ensuring that doses reached their destination in the shortest time possible. To achieve this goal, we considered various factors, including:

- Distances between distribution points and vaccination locations.
- Freight costs to different regions.
- Availability of transportation vehicles.
- Time constraints for vaccine delivery.

### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** We used JavaScript as the primary programming language to develop the optimization algorithm.

- **MapTiler API:** The MapTiler API provided us with advanced mapping and geolocation features, allowing us to create interactive visualizations to enhance routing efficiency.
