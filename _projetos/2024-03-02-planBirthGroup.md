## About

This project was developed as part of an academic work for the college and aims to create a birth management system at priority levels, considering the availability of doctors and different levels of capabilities. In addition, the system also covers the management of working hours, hospital opening hours, hours worked by doctors and their respective weekly days off.

## Functionalities

- Prioritization of births based on specific criteria.
- Assignment of available doctors according to capacity and specialization.
- Management of doctors' working hours.
- Control of hospital opening hours.
- Monitoring of hours worked by doctors.
- Scheduling and monitoring doctors' weekly days off.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, make sure you have the following input documents:

1. **Doctors List:** A document that contains the list of available doctors, their working hours, priority level, and medical experience.

2. **List of Births:** A document that represents the list of births to be managed, including time, availability and relevant information about each birth.

Make sure these documents are formatted correctly for proper integration with your prioritized birth management system.


## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/seu-projeto.git
    cd your-project
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

     ```console
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Run the system:
     ```console
     python main.py
     ```

4. Make sure you have the entry documents (Doctor List and Delivery List) ready as described in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section

## Usage

To use the Priority Delivery Management System, follow the steps below:

1. **Document Preparation:**
    - Make sure you have the necessary documents: the Doctors List and the Birth List.
    - These documents must be correctly formatted text files, containing information such as doctors' working hours, availability, priority level and medical experience.

2. **Program Execution:**
    - Clone the repository to your local environment.
    - Install the dependencies using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
    - Run the main program with the command `python main.py`.
   
3. **Text File Input:**
    - During execution, the program will ask for the paths of the required text files.
    - Provide the full path to the Doctor List file when prompted.
    - Then provide the full path to the Birth List file when prompted.

4. **Processing and Results:**
    - The system will process information from entry documents and manage priority deliveries, taking into account the availability of doctors, priority level and medical experience.
    - The results or reports generated by the system will be available at the end of the execution.

Make sure that the text files are properly filled with the necessary information before starting to run the program.


## Contribution

The Priority Birth Management System is an open source project, and we are happy to receive contributions from the community. If you are a developer interested in contributing, we consider the following areas for improvement:

1. **Addition of View Interfaces:**
    - Explore the possibility of creating graphical or visual interfaces to make the user experience more intuitive.
    - Integrate graphics libraries, such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Dash, to create representations visual representations of system results or facilitate data entry.

2. **Efficiency and Performance Improvements:**
    - Contributions related to code optimizations, performance improvements and bug fixes are always welcome.

3. **Enhanced Documentation:**
    - Improve existing documentation, including details about the code structure, how data is processed, and any other information useful for new contributors.

### How to Contribute:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local environment.
2. Create a branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b feature/nova-interface`.
3. Implement the desired changes.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new view interface'`.
5. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/nova-interface`.
6. Open a pull request explaining your changes and the benefits they bring to the project.

Remembering that before starting work on a new feature, it is always recommended to open an issue to discuss the proposal and ensure alignment with the project objectives.
